## Reading Response "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction."

### How does this apply to digital games?

The main topic in the artice, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"by Walter Benjamin, is the uniqueness of the art in the age when copying and reproducing is very easy, affordable and profitable. In his opinion, the piece of art is the unique entity where the labor and soul of an artist got embeded by artist's labor. And no matter how many times it got copied, it wouldn't be the same as the original piece. He, also, says that viewer's perception and the feeling associated with experiencing that art is something that can not be replicated. Throughout the ages, people were the one who decided what art was and how to interpret it. Lately, however, it is very easy to replicate a product of an art and the audience began to percieve that as the work of art in itself.

Digital games is another medium for an art. Someone created an atmosphere and experience that user usually get. People feel something with the game. But uniqueness of games got narrowed down from the inception of the ghames. When digital games first came out, like Doom, World of Warcraft, Quake, it was such a unique and never-done-before kind of thing, it felt like a piece of art. However, the games got modified and copied. Today there are tons of games that represents some kind of modified copy of itself. The uniqueness of the games got transparent and narrowed down. It is possible to create an art of a first shooter games, or an art of a mobile game, etc. Digital games have to follow the pattern of creating something that profitable, so it would have a chance to compete with other similar games. Companies have to obey the politics of the market in order to create something, so a lot of times the uniqueness of the game gets pushed back. At the end of his article Walter Benjamin wrote that in the age of mechanical reproduction, art got based on politics instead of rituals. Games got based on politics, too.
