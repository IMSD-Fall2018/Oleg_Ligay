First Project "Control"

0. This is an individual project. 
1. Make an interactive Unity scene
	Must be 1 unity scene
	Must be interactive - accepts user input
	Can be a 3D or 2D scene
	"Found" graphics, things you make yourself,
	(but not defaults)
2. Process user input, and do something in the scene
	Can use the scripts we've written, if you add to them
	What the scene does has to be script-driven
3. Can be a "game", but probably isn't
