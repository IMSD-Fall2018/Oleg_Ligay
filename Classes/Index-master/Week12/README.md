### Procedural Story Small Assignment
+ Using arrays of strings, make a small procedural story and print it to the console using Debug.Log();
	+ Make a paragraph that inserts at least 10 different words or phrases. 
	+ Save the entire Unity Project to your repo as "MadLibs"
  + Bonus Points: Try outputting the story to a TextMesh (Create->3D Object->3D Text)
  + If you're not sure how to get started, there's a sample in the project I've uploaded here!
